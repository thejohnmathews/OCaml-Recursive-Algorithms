# sde2.caml - John Mathews CPSC 3520 - 100/100

Pledge: On my honor I have neither given nor received aid on this exam.

The overall objective of SDE2 is to implement 4 sets of functions
corresponding to 4 different list-based problems. Three of these problems
were inspired by actual coding tests given during interviews for
positions with companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft and
Apple. This project is to be done using a purely functional programming
paradigm and ocaml. Some of the problems which inspired this
assignment refer to arrays or strings. The common (and required) data
structure in this assignment is the ocaml list. The problems are:
first duplicate in a list problem:
first non-repeating in a list problem:
the sum of 2 problem:
CYK parsing algorithm-inspired list decomposition problem:
Given n, return a list of tuples, each indicating how a string of length n
could be formed from 2 strings. [(1,n-1); (2,n-2);...;(n-1,1)] is the
returned ocaml list.
